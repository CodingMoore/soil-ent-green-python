__Name of Student:__ Randel Moore

__Name of Project:__ Soil-Ent Green

__Project's Purpose or Goal:__ Show a user of the moisture content of the soil of a houseplant.

__List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:__

* Have Raspberry Pi send simulated data to firestore API/database.
* Frontend pulls data from firestore/database.
* Data is presented to the user as a graph.

__What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.__

* Raspberry Pi with Python for sending data to Firestore.
* Firestore backend for storing the data in an online database.
* React frontend for presenting the data/graph for the user.

__If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.__

* Get real data from the Raspberry Pi sensor(s) (instead of simulated data).
* Add additional types of data, like the amount of light the plant is receiving.
* User alerts/notifications when the soil has become too dry.

__What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?__
* N/A

__Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?__
* N/A
